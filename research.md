## My Motivation

I am eager to understand how biomolecules work in life. 
To pursue this, I apply computer simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics simulation. 
Computer simulation allows us to address complicated biological phenomena through a simple physical model (e.g., one protein and one substrate). 
This simplification can be an effective way to figure out what aspects are essential in the phenomena.

Recently, I have studied the following topics: 

## Cryptic Binding Site of Proteins

Cryptic binding sites are binding sites that are transiently formed in an apo form or that are induced by ligand binding. In our study[^1], we have investigated 18 proteins with a known crytptic binding site via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings are: 

- Aromatic amino-acid residues are ubiquitous in cryptic binding sites.
- Their side-chain fluctuations are so unique that they can be used to predict cryptic binding sites from canonical MD simulations of unliganded proteins. 
- The side-chain fluctuations probe the pocket that bind to a known ligand; we thus suggest that the side-chain fluctuations provide a blueprint for fragment-based drug design strategy.

## Intrinsically Disordererd Proteins

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are the proteins that do not form a well-defined tertially structure. As a model protein, we investigated p53 C-terminal domain (p53 CTD). Firstly, we examined the effects of acetylation on p53 CTD's conformational ensemble via an enhanced-sampling MD simulations and circular dichroism spectrosocpy.[^2] We found that the acetylation increases the helical propensity of p53 CTD, which appeared preferable for binding to a certain proteins. Our study proposed a switching mechanism by acetylation in terms of atomistic picture.
