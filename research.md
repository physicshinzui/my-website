## Cryptic Binding Site of Proteins

We have found unique side-chain fluctuations of cryptic binding sites via molecular dynamics simulations.

## Intrinsically Disordererd Protein

We have explored the structural ensemble of an intrinsically disordered region, p53 C-terminal domain, via a generalised ensemble molecular dynamics simulation. We have identified various binding modes on a target protein.

## SARS-CoV-2 main protease

We have investigated monomeric and dimeric states of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, identifying water molecules that can be crucial to keep the dyad configuration.
