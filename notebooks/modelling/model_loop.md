## Prerequisits
- Chimera (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/)
- Licence number of Modeller (https://salilab.org/modeller/)


## Workflow
1. Open a PDB file by chimera.
2. Go to `Tools -> Model/Refine loops`
3. Select a chain that has a missing loop of interest
4. Press `OK`, and then two windows appear for the sequence and modelling setting.
5. Select a missing residues, which may be surrounded by a red rectangle if the PDB contains the information of where the missing residues are.
6. Press `Apply` in the windown `Model Loops/Refine Structure`.
